# Loop Notes

- loop
- while true - loop over code
- for - for a certain number of times
- iterate - each time it loops
- condition - think of conditional statements.  while ((true && true) || false)
- increment - increase (possibly by 1)
- decrement decrease (possibly by 1)

- `i++` shorthand meaning  i = i + 1 // think of ++ as variable plus 1

#### for loops - do things a certain number of times
```
for (var i = 0; i < 10; i++){
  console.log(i);
}

for(this; many; times;){
  //do the thing;
}
```

#### while loops - do things while conditions are true (or not met)
```
var response;
while(response !== house){
  var response = prompt("would you like a house or hotel?;)
}

var catLover;

while (catLover !== 'yes'){
  var catLover = prompt('Do you love cats?  Please say yes!')
}


while (true){
  //do the thing;
}
